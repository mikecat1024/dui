# Project Commands

- `pnpm check`
- `pnpm storybook`

## Required Workflow

- Align implementation and variable naming with the contents of specs.md.
- Implement components to be fully compliant with Material Design (MD3).
- In specs.md, only use items and naming that appear on the corresponding m3.material.io spec page.
- Ignore the MD3 Expressive updates; follow the original M3 spec naming and sizing.
- Do not introduce or use variables/tokens that are not defined in `specs.md`.
- Use camelCase for variable and token keys (no hyphens).
